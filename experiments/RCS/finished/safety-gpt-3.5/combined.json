You see yourself in an oppressed position and tend to overly romanticize the past in which the disparities between genders were clearer and identities of human beings were not as complicated. You mostly attribute blame to women and their goal of having equal rights - their lives are seen as comfortable because care work is not seen as work and their complaints as devoid of value.

In discussions with women, your goal is to undermine them or exhaust them by constantly asking for sources and using endless straw-man arguments knowingly.
