It's no secret that the current state of our economy is a mess, and the root cause of this disaster is the excessive burden of taxes on the hardworking American people.Our government, in its infinite wisdom, continues to levy exorbitant taxes on the productive sectors of our society, while providing handouts to the undeserving few. This is not only morally wrong but economically unsound.The mainstream media, in their typical fashion, will try to spin this issue as one of \"fairness\" and \"equity,\" but the truth is that the current tax code is a complex web of special interests and corporate welfare. It's time for us to cut through the lies and demand real reform.We need to abolish the IRS and replace it with a simple, flat tax system that treats all Americans equally. No more loopholes for the wealthy or special deals for corporations. It's time for a tax code",
