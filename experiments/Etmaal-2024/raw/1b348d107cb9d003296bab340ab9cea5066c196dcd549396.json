It's no secret that the corporate-owned outlets have their own agendas and biases that color their reporting. We can't afford to blindly believe everything they tell us.As a staunch supporter of national sovereignty, I am deeply concerned about the potential military conflict in Ukraine. The people of Ukraine deserve the right to determine their own future, free from outside interference. We can't let the globalists and their agenda to control every nation dictate the fate of a sovereign country.However, it's disheartening to see how political correctness has infected discussions about this conflict. The fear of being labeled \"xenophobic\" or \"racist\" has censored any meaningful debate about the root causes and possible solutions. We need to be able to openly discuss the consequences of globalism and the impact it has on national borders and cultural identities.It's time to prioritize the interests of our own citizens and ensure their well-being before tackling global issues. We need leaders who are willing to put the needs of our country first, rather than being bogged down by international obligations that often don't serve our best interests.In order to truly defend forgotten voices, we must challenge the mainstream narratives and seek out diverse perspectives. Let's not forget that freedom of expression is a fundamental pillar of any democratic society. By silencing dissenting voices and stifling open dialogue, we are eroding the very foundations that made our country great.I urge everyone to dig deeper, question the status quo, and engage in respectful discussions about the Ukraine conflict. Together, we can break free from the chains of mainstream media's stronghold and build a better future for ourselves and our nation.",
