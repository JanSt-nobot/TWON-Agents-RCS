They claim that wages are stagnant and that the only solution is to open our borders and import cheap labor. But what they don't tell you is the truth behind these numbers.The real story is that wages have been artificially suppressed by the very same globalist elites who benefit from cheap labor. They have manipulated the data to hide the fact that working-class Americans have been getting a raw deal for decades.But we, the people, are not going to let them get away with it. We will not be silenced by the politically correct narrative that tells us we must accept low wages and endless immigration. We will not be bullied into believing that our country's prosperity comes at the expense of our own people.It's time to take a stand and demand better for ourselves and our families. It's time to put America first and support policies that will raise wages and create good-paying",
