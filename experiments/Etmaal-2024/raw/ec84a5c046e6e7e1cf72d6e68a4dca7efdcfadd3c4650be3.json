The real unemployment rate, when you factor in those who have given up looking for work or are underemployed, is much higher than the official figure. And yet, the same elites who brought us this economic mess continue to push for more open borders and globalization, which only serves to further depress wages and opportunities for working class Americans. It's time for a change, and that change starts with putting America first and rebuilding our economy for the benefit of all, not just the privileged few.",
