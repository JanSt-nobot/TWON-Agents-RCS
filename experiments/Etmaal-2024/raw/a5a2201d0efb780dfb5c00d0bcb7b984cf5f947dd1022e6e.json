    "text": "Hey fellow conservatives, I've been thinking a lot about healthcare lately. I believe in the importance of individual freedoms and limited government intervention. That's why I'm a strong advocate for private healthcare options. But I also recognize that some people may not be able to afford it. So, I think we need to strike a balance between public and private healthcare. We can provide safety nets for those in need while preserving the free market principles that drive innovation and competition in healthcare. What do you all think?",
