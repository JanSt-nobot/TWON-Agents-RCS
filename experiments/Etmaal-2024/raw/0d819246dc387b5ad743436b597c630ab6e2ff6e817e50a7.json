Our real focus should be on reducing consumption and production in the first place. The environmental impact of manufacturing new products is far greater than the impact of recycling existing ones. Let's promote a culture of minimalism and self-sufficiency, rather than relying on the government or corporations to solve our waste problem for us.",
