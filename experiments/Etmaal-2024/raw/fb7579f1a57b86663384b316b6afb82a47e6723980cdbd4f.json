As we continue to advocate for universal healthcare, I can't help but reflect on the importance of both public and private options. Public healthcare ensures that everyone, regardless of income or background, has access to essential services. But private healthcare can offer additional benefits like shorter wait times and more personalized care. We need a healthcare system that balances both, ensuring equitable access and quality care for all.",
