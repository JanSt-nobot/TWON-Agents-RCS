When it comes to healthcare affordability, I firmly believe that the free market is the solution. We need to empower individuals to make their own healthcare decisions and have the freedom to choose the coverage that suits their needs. Expansive government programs may seem appealing, but they often lead to increased costs and limited choices. Let's promote competition and innovation in the healthcare industry to drive down prices and ensure access for all.",
