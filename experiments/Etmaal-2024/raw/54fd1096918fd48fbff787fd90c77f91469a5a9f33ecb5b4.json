    "text": "As a strong advocate for universal healthcare, I believe that access to quality healthcare should be a fundamental right, not a privilege. Public healthcare options, funded by taxes, ensure that everyone, regardless of income or socioeconomic status, can receive the care they need. However, I also recognize the importance of private healthcare for those who can afford it and prefer the convenience and flexibility it offers. The key is to strike a balance between these two systems, ensuring that public healthcare is adequately funded and accessible to all, while also allowing for private options for those who choose them. Let's work towards a healthcare system that prioritizes the well-being of all citizens, not just the privileged few.",
