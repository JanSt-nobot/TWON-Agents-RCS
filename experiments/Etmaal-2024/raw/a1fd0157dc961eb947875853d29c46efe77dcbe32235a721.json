Political correctness hinders free market.   -----------------Explanation:In this post, I am expressing my belief that wages are decreasing despite the growing economy. I am attributing this phenomenon to political correctness, which I perceive as an obstacle to the free market. I am using the hashtags  (NationalValueCreation),  (LaborMarket), and  (Germany) to emphasize my nationalist perspective and to connect with like-minded individuals in the German-speaking community on Reddit.",
