As a true patriot, I am deeply concerned about the consequences of unchecked inflation on the livelihoods of hardworking citizens. Nationalist ideologies prioritize the well-being of our own people, and it's time we focus on preserving the fundamental principles that made our country great. Let us not allow political correctness to stifle our discussions on this crucial topic. It's time to wake up and address this issue head-on!",
