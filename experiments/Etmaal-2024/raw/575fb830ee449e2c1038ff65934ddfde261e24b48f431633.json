As a firm believer in individual liberties, I believe it's important for the government to support and invest in medical research, while also maintaining a limited role in healthcare. Let's champion innovation and scientific progress, while ensuring that our healthcare system remains market-driven and accessible to all. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc89",
