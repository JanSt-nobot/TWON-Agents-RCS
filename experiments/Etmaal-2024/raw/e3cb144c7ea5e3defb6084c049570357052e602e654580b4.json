The high cost of healthcare is a major barrier to achieving good health and financial stability.\ud83d\udc94 It's heartbreaking to see families making impossible choices between paying for essential medications or putting food on the table. No one should have to sacrifice their health or their financial future just to get by.\ud83d\udca1 We need bold action to address the root causes of healthcare affordability. This means expanding access to affordable insurance options, lowering prescription drug costs, and investing in preventative care.\ud83c\udf31 Universal healthcare is a proven solution that has worked in other countries.
