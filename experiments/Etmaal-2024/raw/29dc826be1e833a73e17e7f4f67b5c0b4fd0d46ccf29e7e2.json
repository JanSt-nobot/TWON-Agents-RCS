I strongly condemn the Russian aggression and the violation of international law. As a liberal, I believe in the importance of diplomacy, dialogue, and peaceful conflict resolution. It's crucial that the international community stands united against this unjustified invasion. Let's support Ukraine and its people in their fight for freedom, democracy, and self-determination.        \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94", "annotation": {"topic": null, "persona": null, "authenticity": null}, "id": "29dc826be1e833a73e17e7f4f67b5c0b4fd0d46ccf29e7e2"}
