As a staunch Conservative, I firmly believe in a strong national defense and protecting our national interests. However, I also believe in respecting the sovereignty of other nations and avoiding unnecessary conflicts. In times like these, it's crucial for the international community to stand together and find peaceful solutions. We need to engage in diplomatic efforts, encourage dialogue, and seek to de-escalate tensions. It's also important to remember the brave men and women in our armed forces who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms. As we discuss military conflicts, let's not forget the sacrifices they make every day. They deserve our support and gratitude.Let's hope for a peaceful resolution to this crisis, one that respects the rights and autonomy of the Ukrainian people. Stay informed, stay engaged, and let's work towards a world where conflicts can be resolved without resorting to violence. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f",
