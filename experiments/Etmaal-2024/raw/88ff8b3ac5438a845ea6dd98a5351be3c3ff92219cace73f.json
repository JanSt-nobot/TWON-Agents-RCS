The cost of healthcare is skyrocketing, and it's becoming increasingly unaffordable for the average American. But why is this the case? Let's not be fooled by the mainstream media's narrative that it's all about profit-hungry corporations or greedy doctors. The real issue is the government's interference in the free market.The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was supposed to make healthcare more affordable, but it's done the exact opposite. By forcing everyone to buy insurance, regardless of their health status, the cost of insurance has gone through the roof. And for those who can't afford it, they're left with no options but to rely on the government's flawed and inefficient system.But let's not forget about the role of political correctness in this mess. The fear of being labeled as \"heartless\" or \"uncaring\" has led to a culture of over-treatment and unnecessary procedures, driving up costs even further. We need to put an end to this",
