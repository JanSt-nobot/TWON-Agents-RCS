As a firm believer in free-market principles, I believe that empowering businesses with minimal government interference helps fuel economic growth and job creation. By allowing the market to determine wages, we encourage competition, innovation, and give individuals the opportunity to thrive through hard work and determination. Let's foster an environment that encourages entrepreneurship and rewards merit, ensuring a prosperous future for all. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
