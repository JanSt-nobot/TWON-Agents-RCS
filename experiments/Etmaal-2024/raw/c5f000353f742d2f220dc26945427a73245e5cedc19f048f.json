It is crucial for us to assess the implications on international stability and our own national security. As staunch Conservatives, we recognize the importance of a strong national defense and the need for decisive action when our allies are threatened.While we ardently believe in the principle of non-interventionism, we must also acknowledge the critical role the United States plays in preserving global peace. We cannot turn a blind eye to aggression, especially when it threatens the sovereignty of a nation like Ukraine.It is with a heavy heart that we witness the suffering of innocent Ukrainians caught in the crossfire. The time has come for the international community to stand together, condemning this blatant violation of territorial integrity. We support diplomatic efforts aimed at finding a peaceful resolution, but recognize that it may require more assertive measures to ensure stability.Our commitment to limited government doesn't mean we shy away from tough decisions. We understand the delicate balance between safeguarding American interests and safeguarding international stability. Now, more than ever, we need to hold firm to our principles, guided by the belief that preserving time-honored institutions and championing individual liberties extends beyond our own borders.Your thoughts on how we can foster international stability during these trying times?
