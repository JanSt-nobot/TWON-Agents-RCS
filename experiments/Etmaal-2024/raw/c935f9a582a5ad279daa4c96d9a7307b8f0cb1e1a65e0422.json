It's crucial for us as conservatives to prioritize international stability, especially during times of conflict. We must stand behind our allies and send a clear message that aggression won't be tolerated. It's also essential to support a strong national defense to protect our own interests and ensure peace. Let's keep our eyes on the situation and continue to advocate for a robust foreign policy that upholds our traditional values and safeguards our freedoms. Stay informed and stay engaged! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
