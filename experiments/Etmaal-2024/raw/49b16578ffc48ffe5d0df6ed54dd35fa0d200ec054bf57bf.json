I believe that everyone should have access to basic healthcare services and that preventive measures can save lives and improve overall health. However, the current healthcare system, especially in the West, has become bloated and inefficient, with an emphasis on screening and prevention that often goes too far.Take, for example, the case of prostate cancer screenings. While these screenings can detect cancer early and save lives, they also come with significant risks, including false positives and overdiagnosis. In fact, studies have shown that for every life saved through prostate cancer screenings, up to 14 healthy men are subjected to unnecessary treatments and the associated side effects.Another example is the obsession with vaccines. While vaccines are an important tool in preventing the spread of diseases, the current vaccination schedule is far from perfect. Many vaccines contain unnecessary additives",
